Data Mining Projects Repository

Welcome to my Data Mining Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of data mining and machine learning projects, showcasing various analytical methods applied to different datasets. Each project explores distinct techniques for extracting insights and creating visualizations from data.

Overview

This repository is a compilation of data mining and machine learning projects. It demonstrates the use of several methodologies for data analysis, prediction, and pattern recognition. From simple linear regressions to complex neural network models, this repository serves as a practical guide for exploring a wide range of data science techniques.


Methods and Techniques

The following analytical methods are explored:

Linear Regression: Predictive analysis using a linear relationship between variables.

Multivariable Regression: Extending linear regression to handle multiple input features.

Logistic Regression: Classification method for binary outcomes.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric method for classification and regression.

Decision Trees: A tree-based structure for classification and regression.

Neural Networks: Simulating human brain-like structures for complex predictions.

Cluster Analysis: Grouping data points based on similarity.

Association Rules: Discovering relationships between variables in large datasets.


Datasets Used

Each project utilizes one or more datasets, ranging from publicly available sources to custom-prepared data. Example datasets include:

Customer demographic and purchase data

Financial transaction records

Health and medical data

Market basket analysis datasets

Climate and environmental data


Visualizations

Visualizations are a key part of these projects, providing insights into data and model performance. Examples of visualizations include:

Scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots

Correlation heatmaps

Decision boundaries for classification models

Clustering results displayed in 2D/3D plots

Neural network training curves

Association rule graphs
